# Customer_behavior_analysis
Customer Behavior Data Analytics Project
📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using an end-to-end data analytics workflow. The objective is to extract meaningful business insights by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python, executing SQL-based analysis on relational databases, and presenting insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard, a written report, and a presentation (PPT).

This project demonstrates practical skills required for Business Analyst / Data Analyst roles.

📁 Dataset

Type: Customer transaction & behavior data

Records: ~3,900 customer purchases

Features include:

Customer demographics (age, gender, location)

Purchase details (product, category, amount, season)

Behavioral data (discount usage, subscriptions, ratings, shipping type)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Databases: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

SQL: Joins, Aggregations, CTEs, Window Functions

Power BI: Data modeling, DAX, interactive dashboards

Presentation: Gamma (AI-powered PPT creation)

Others: GitHub, Jupyter Notebook

🔄 Project Workflow / Steps

1️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration (Python)

Loaded dataset using Pandas

Reviewed data structure and summary statistics

Identified missing values and inconsistencies

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Handled missing values using appropriate techniques

Standardized column names

Created derived features (age groups, customer segments, etc.)

Prepared clean data for database storage

3️⃣ SQL Analysis (Database Layer)

Loaded cleaned data into relational databases

Wrote SQL queries to answer business questions such as:

Revenue by gender and age group

Subscriber vs non-subscriber behavior

Top products by rating and sales

Discount impact on purchasing

Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)

4️⃣ Data Visualization (Power BI)

Built an interactive dashboard including:

KPI cards (customers, revenue, average spend)

Sales by category and age group

Subscription and customer segment analysis

Filters for dynamic analysis

5️⃣ Reporting & Presentation

Created a structured business report summarizing insights

Designed a professional PPT using Gamma for stakeholder presentation

📊 Dashboard Highlights

Total customers and revenue overview
